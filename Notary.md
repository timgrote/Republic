Notary is a person of trust. They are held in trust by the circle they serve.

An initial idea is that the notary is a verified person. They will be trusted to issue a [[VotingToken]] to the address provided by the person they are verifying.

The voter will meet the notary in meatspace (office, public park, a home) and verify their gov ID matches their face & details, and verify the corresponding regetered voter ID in the gov database.  The voter presents a public address in the form of a QR code

The notary can then
- issue a governance token to the voter address
- input that address into a centralized database of verified voters
- digitally sign a contract saying that the voters ID has been verified.
- something else

I'm not sure which of these methods will be the most practical or efficient.
