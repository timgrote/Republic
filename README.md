# Republic
This repo contains thoughts and ideas about how to build a better republic, or maybe just a better social media. [Identity](https://github.com/timgrote/Republic/blob/main/Identity.md) is important for both these projects

Right now it's a vault in obsidian, till I figure out what format it should be in, or start adding code/other repos

You can open the repo folder in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or just browse around the files in Github for now.  Note the obsidian links aren't  working in github and most of the files are in the [Voting folder.](https://github.com/timgrote/Republic/tree/main/Voting)

Intention: Build a voting app, probably on  some layer of the ETH chain using web3.js+react+node.js. If the identity part of it starts working, figure out a way to apply it to social networking and news.


### Feedback
This is a huge mind boggling task. It's an experiment really. It'll probably fail. 
Feel free to give feedback.
- Tell us we're doing it wrong and how it will fail and we'll probably ignore it. 
- Tell us how you think it should be written, we might listen. 
- Write how you think it should be written, then submit a pull request, we'll definitely listen.
