# Republic
This repo contains thoughts and ideas about how to build a better republic, or maybe just a better social media. 

Right now it's a vault in obsidian, till I figure out what format it should be in, or find a project to put my time into. 

You can open the repo folder in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), or just browse around the files in Github for now.
