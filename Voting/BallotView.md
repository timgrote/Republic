Part of the [[Voting Project]]

This view is basically a list of things to vote for. From bills to elected leaders.

All voters in the US see the federal ballot.
All voters in a state see the state ballot this goes on for counties, cities, etc.

Users can input (and change?) their votes in this vote. This is the view where the user signs their ballot to verify it publicly.

This view is what the user interacts with to vote.
We can either format is as closely to the real life ballot they would see, or put our own spin on it.

I like the idea of randomizing the order of candidates every time the ballot is viewed. Takes power away from the 'top two'
