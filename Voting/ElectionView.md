This view displays an election, which is basically a collection of votes. Votes can be displayed as numerical values. I like the idea of a pie chart. A map also might be useful, but may be a relic of the electoral college. No reason to dismiss maps though. 

Part of the view is the ability to zoom in and see your vote alongside your fellow voters. It provides a sense of community, part of something bigger than the whole. When you zoom in to see your individual vote, a little tooltip shows up and gives you some individual information about your vote. Private information is decrypted  and can be verified by the user. Tapping/clicking on this tooltip takes you to the [[BallotView]]

Elections happen at different geographical levels, national, state, etc. A map might be a useful tool in drilling in and out of different elections. Useful as a way to zoom in and out of different elections, not just the ones the user has participated in. This in it's self might be a useful tool.

### Enhancement Ideas
- Might be cool to tap on another vote and show the public information on that vote, some kind of hash or something. The actual information will be encrypted of course but you can see the public information displayed.
