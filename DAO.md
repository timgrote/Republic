A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO), sometimes called a decentralized autonomous corporation (DAC), is an organization constructed by rules encoded as a computer program that is often transparent, controlled by the organization's members and not influenced by a central government.

Perhaps it's worth [researching the structure and operations of a DAO](https://www.alchemy.com/overviews/the-definitive-guide-to-starting-a-dao#dao-13). We have to have people at the helm of this thing. I would not leave it completely in the hands of smart contracts yet.

However. DAOs are already voting on things, including how to write and deploy the smart contracts that govern the DAO. This seems like it could be a very useful idea.
One way of doing this is with a [governance token](https://docs.alchemy.com/docs/how-to-create-a-dao-governance-token) 

A DAO could enforce [[Identity]] on its members, and let them participate in voting and elections. A DAO could probably have it's own [[Reputation]] as some function of it's actions.
